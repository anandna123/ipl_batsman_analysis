For using this, please edit variable names bat_player_1, bat_player_2 & bat_player_3 as any player in deliveries.csv. The output would be saved in a folder named as 'Analysis_Results'. The script (ipynb) would take around 50 seconds to complete. You would get a 5 page pdf and 5 separate png files with the charts.

This provides the weaknesses of the batsman as well as the break-ups are scores by venue, weekday, chasing/batting first, how out and frequency etc. If you are a cricket enthusiast, this would be quite interesting. Datasets are also provided in the repository (deliveries.csv and matches.csv)

All the packages listed above needs to be installed as pre-requisites. Default players chosen are bat_player_1 = 'V Kohli', bat_player_2 = 'RG Sharma' and bat_player_3 = 'SPD Smith'.

Hope you like it. If there is any feedback, feel free to let me know.
